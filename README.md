# Wifi-Data-Quota
A quick and dirty calculator that tells me how much data I may use by this day in the fiscal month so that I do not go over by the end of the fiscal month.
It takes in two inputs, the total monthly quota in megabytes (5 GiB = 5120 MiB) and the last day of the fiscal month. There is only one output, how many megabytes (MiB) that I may use by the end of the day since the beginning of the fiscal month.  Enter that value in my "Mobile Data" -> "Set data usage limit" and the phone will turn off the data if I go over.  Then at the end of the month, I will still have data to spare.
